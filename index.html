    <h1>For Aayusha 💌</h1>
    <p>It’s been 20 months… 20 months of laughter, late-night talks 🌙, silly fights, deep conversations 💬, countless memories, and moments that made my heart feel something I had never felt before ❤️. From the very first time we started talking, to the way we slowly became each other's comfort, best friend, and person—I’ve cherished every second of this journey with you, Aayusha.

We’ve had our ups and downs ⬆️⬇️, and yes, we both have made mistakes. We’ve hurt each other, knowingly or unknowingly 💔. But through it all, one thing has never changed—my love for you. And if anything, this distance, this recent gap, this silence… it’s only made me realize how deeply I need you in my life 💭.

I don’t want to hold onto the past anymore 🕰️. I don’t care who was right or wrong. I’m ready to let go of my ego, my attitude, my expectations—because you matter more than any of that 🙏. You are not just a part of my life; you are my life 🌍.

I want to say sorry for everything I’ve done that hurt you 😔. I’ve realized my mistakes, and I’m not here to make excuses—I just want a chance to make things right. A fresh start. A new beginning 🌱.

I miss the warmth of your voice, the way your eyes sparkled when you smiled ✨, the way we used to talk about the future like we already belonged to each other. I miss us so much 🥺. And the truth is—I can't go forward without you 🚫➡️. I can't imagine my life without you in it 🤍.

No matter what happened in the past, and no matter what the future holds, I want to be with you. Permanently. Forever ♾️. Through every fight, every laugh, every breakdown, and every celebration—I want you. Only you 👩‍❤️‍👨.

I love you madly, Mutu ❤️‍🔥. And I always will. Let’s forget everything else and start a new chapter, just you and me—stronger, wiser, and more in love than ever before ✨.</p>
